# CS 142 Lab 2

## Tic Tac Toe

In this lab, you will play and modify a game already written for you in Java.  Through 
playing the game and investigating the code, you will practice with using functions, Java 
objects, calling instance methods, and multidimensional arrays.

### Getting started

1. Start IntelliJ.  Follow the instructions (from class/the webpage on January 12th) for pulling the latest version of the in-class code using Git.  You'll create a project using the same link from last week: https://github.com/ncp38/cs142-s24-inclass

2. In the left-hand panel, expand the `src` folder to see today's lab 
    (in the `lab3` folder).  Double-click on `TicTacToe` (not the `md`
    file yet.)  If you get a yellow bar at the top that says "Project JDK is
    not defined," then click on "Setup SDK" and choose the JDK you downloaded
    earlier.

3. In the left-hand panel, double-click on `TicTacToe.md`.  Follow
    the instructions in this file.  This is where you will answer the questions
    for the lab.

**Note**: You do not need to open the `SimpleCanvas` file.

### Submitting the lab

When you are done, please turn in the `TicTacToe.java` file and 
the `TicTacToe.md` file to canvas.

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and any teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 2 - Tic Tac Toe
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 180-235 to allow three player games on different-sized boards.
```
