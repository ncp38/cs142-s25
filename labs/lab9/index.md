# CS 142 Lab 9

For this lab, we'll be using new randomized partners!  (Your pairing will be put up on the screen at the beginning of class.)

## backtracking

In this lab, you’ll explore the concept of backtracking! You’ll learn what backtracking is, evaluate how it could be implemented programmatically, and begin to think about it as an algorithm.

### Getting started

Pair up with your partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Code Source

https://github.com/ncp38/cs142-s24-inclass

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file. 

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
