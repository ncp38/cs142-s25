# CS 142 Lab 8

For this lab, you can pick your own partner!

## The snake game

You'll investigate and design a classic Snake game, where a player controls a snake on a 2D grid as it seeks to eat items to become bigger!  This will help you improve your ability to make design choices in your programming, use/practice with ArrayLists and Strings, and practice with instantiating objects and calling instance methods on them.

### Getting started

Pair up with your partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Code Source

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file. 

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
