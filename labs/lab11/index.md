# CS 142 Lab 11

## Design and Programming with Object-Oriented Programming

In this lab, you will practice using polymorphism and test the limits of polymorphic design.  You'll work through a real-life example of how polymorphism can be used to help us solve programming problems (and can make your own object-oriented quizzes while you're at it!).  

### Getting started

Pair up with your partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Code Source

https://github.com/ncp38/cs142-s25-inclass

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file. 

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
