# CS 142 Lab 11 - The One Where You Learn How To Make Money With Math (but, no, please don't try this at home!)

For this lab, you can choose a partner of your choice!  (Make sure that you partner with at least one other person; if there's an odd number of people in the class we'll do a three-person group.)

## Blackjack and Programming with Object-Oriented Programming

In this lab, you'll work with functions related to playing a game of blackjack!  When you finish, you'll have explored new elements of object-oriented programming, including enums and interfaces, as well as other standard OOP concepts.

### Getting started

Pair up with your partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Code Source

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file. 

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
