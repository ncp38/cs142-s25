# CS 142 Lab 3

## Self-Driving Racecars

In this lab, you will play and modify a program already written for you in Java.  Through 
using the program and modifying it, you will practice with designing and using your own classes.
This will be your first lab with a partner!

### Getting started

Follow the instructions given to you.

### Code Source

https://github.com/ncp38/cs142-s24-inclass

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file.

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
