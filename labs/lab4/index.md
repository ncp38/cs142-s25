# CS 142 Lab 4

For this lab, we're continuing to pick our partners!  

## Self-Driving Racecars

In this lab, you will continue working on the racecar program from last week.  This lab will help you think critically about classes, programming structure, and design.

### Getting started

Partner up with your partner, then create a new project from version control (as we've been doing for the last several classes).  Follow the instructions in the .md file!

### Code Source

https://github.com/ncp38/cs142-s24-inclass

### Submitting the lab

When you and your partner are done, please turn in the Java files and the questions.md file.  

-Each Java file you upload should include a header with an assignment title, your name, class number/period, and your teammates' names.  (Your names need to be listed in the questions.md file as well!)

-Beneath this header include a short description of what you've changed in the file.

For example:

```java
//Lab 1 - Wheel of Fortune
//John Doe, COMP 142 Section 1
//Jane Deere, COMP 142 Section 1
//Changed lines 250-265 to allow the user to bet their earned money on a letter.
```
