# CS142: Homework 2

Homework problems are intended to give you more practice with shorter programs than the larger "projects" do.
Typically these problems will also give you an idea of what you might see on tests.  You also get immediate
feedback.

This is another CodeCheck homework.  If you've forgotten how this works, look at homework 1.

[Here's the link for the assignment.](https://codecheck.io/assignment/2109252210a0l213e9k4rn02hbmh8b3kx3f)

When you're all done, paste your CodeCheck ID into the Canvas assignment and submit it.  

(You may also take screenshots of your code successfully passing the checks in CodeCheck and submit those to canvas instead.  In the past,
a handful of students have said they've experienced problems with CodeCheck not saving their progress, so this
might work better for you.)
