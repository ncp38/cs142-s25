Hey Cameron!

The resources below should be helpful in reviewing recursion/preparing for Exam 2.    I think, though, that these problems should help you review and prepare!



Most of these websites have a number of other practice problems as well; I encourage exploring them to see if they have what you need.  

Let me know if this helps!

Some places that may have helpful practice problems:
https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/method/index.php [simple practice problems-you may need to look up a conversion (such as Fahrenheit to Celsius) but otherwise these problems should be pretty straightforward.]
https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/datatypes/index.php numbers 1-10 

https://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-2
https://codingbat.com/java/AP-1
https://codingbat.com/java/Logic-1

https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/oop/index.php [More challenging problems.  These questions may be longer or a little harder than what's on the exam, but should be similar otherwise.]
https://codingbat.com/java/Array-3





These examples are good for recursion, inheritance, and polymorphism problems.  Though note that polymorphism is not on Exam 2.  The difficulty for these also isn't quite the same as what will be on the test; some are more complex and involved than what's on the test, while others may be a little simpler.

For recursion: https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1 and https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2
For some simple inheritance work: https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/index-inheritance.php
Simple Polymorphism: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/output-java-program-set-25-polymorphism/#

As you work through these problems, let me know if you find them helpful!  (And, if you don't find them helpful, let me know, and we can figure something out!)
