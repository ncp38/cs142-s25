Some places that may have helpful practice problems:
https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/method/index.php [simple practice problems-you may need to look up a conversion (such as Fahrenheit to Celsius) but otherwise these problems should be pretty straightforward.]
https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/datatypes/index.php numbers 1-10 

https://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-2
https://codingbat.com/java/AP-1
https://codingbat.com/java/Logic-1

https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/oop/index.php [More challenging problems.  These questions may be longer or a little harder than what's on the exam, but should be similar otherwise.]

These examples are good for specifically class- and design-based questions:

Finally, here are a few examples involving interpreting code:

This goes all the way from set 1 to set 7, so there's a lot of examples here!  This is generally a little trickier than what we've tackled so far but is great practice!  (There are other examples later on as well, but I think those start covering a few more advanced concepts.)

These two are still reasonable but are a good bit trickier than what we've covered so far.
